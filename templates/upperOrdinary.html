        <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
        <p class="letter-intro">Letter Of Recommendation: {% if gender == "male" %} Mr. {% elif gender == "female" %} Miss {% endif %}{{fullName}}</p>

            <p>
                I write at the instance of {% if gender == "male" %} Mr. {% elif gender == "female" %} Miss {% endif %}{{fullName}} in connection with her postgraduate admission. I have known {{firstName}} for more than {{years}} years when {% if gender == "male" %} he {% elif gender == "female" %} she {% endif %} enrolled in the BSc. Materials Engineering programme at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana. {{firstName}} is a young lady full of ideas and initiative. She has a good command of the English Language, both the written and spoken forms. {% if gender == "male" %} Mr. {% elif gender == "female" %} Miss {% endif %}{{fullName}} is also able to produce excellent work independently and consistently. This was evident in her final year individual project work where she worked on the topic: {{projectTitle}}. She showed a gross understanding of her work which was commended by the panel of lecturers. As her Lecturer, I found her energy, enthusiasm and commitment towards her final-year undergraduate project commendable.
            </p>

                The applicant, though with modest academic achievement, demonstrates zeal and determination to achieve higher academic laurels. Her attitude towards her studies is characterized by a readiness to learn and an openness to new ideas. In short, she is unyielding in her quest for knowledge. She also demonstrates the capability of hard work, maturity, stability, reliability, commitment and tenacity to the achievement of corporate and personal goals. She is also highly motivated, and an excellent team player.

                I am convinced that the applicantâ€™s studies will positively impact on the development of Ghana, her home country and humanity at large. I therefore strongly recommend her for the MSc admission programme into Structural Engineering and Concrete Materials. 
            </p>
            <p>Thank You</p>
            <p>Yours faithfully,</p>

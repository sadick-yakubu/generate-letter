        <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
        <p class="letter-intro">Letter Of Recommendation: {% if gender == "male" %} Mr. {% elif gender == "female" %} Miss {% endif %}{{fullName}}</p>
        <div class="letter-content">
            <p>
                I write at the instance of {% if gender == "male" %} Mr. {% elif gender == "female" %} Miss {% endif %}{{fullName}} in connection with {% if gender == "male" %} his {% elif gender == "female" %} her {% endif %} graduate program application. I have known {{firstName}} for more than {{years}} years. I came to know {% if gender == "male" %} him {% elif gender == "female" %} her {% endif %} very well when {% if gender == "male" %} he {% elif gender == "female" %} she {% endif %} worked directly under me as my undergraduate project student in the Department of Materials Engineering at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST).
            </p>
            <p>
                {% if gender == "male" %} Mr. {% elif gender == "female" %} Miss {% endif %} {{fullName}} whose final year project work was on <em>"{{projectTitle}}"</em>, exhibited selfless dedication, great understanding and in-depth commitment towards the success of {% if gender == "male" %} his {% elif gender == "female" %} her {% endif %} project work. I served as a member of the panel that assessed {% if gender == "male" %} his {% elif gender == "female" %} her {% endif %} undergraduate project defense during which {% if gender == "male" %} he {% elif gender == "female" %} she {% endif %} delivered expressively. As {% if gender == "male" %} his {% elif gender == "female" %} her {% endif %} Lecturer, I found {% if gender == "male" %} his {% elif gender == "female" %} her {% endif %} energy and commitment towards her academics commendable. {{firstName}}'s character, overall intellect and ability to learn are qualities that will serve {% if gender == "male" %} him {% elif gender == "female" %} her {% endif %} well in graduate studies. {% if gender == "male" %} He {% elif gender == "female" %} She {% endif %} graduated with an enviable First Class Honours with a Cumulative Weighted Average of {{cwa}}. As a result of {% if gender == "male" %} his {% elif gender == "female" %} her {% endif %} admirable academic performance, {% if gender == "male" %} he {% elif gender == "female" %} she {% endif %} has been retained as a Teaching/Research Assistant for the 2022/2023 academic year. 
            </p>
            <p>
                {{firstName}} was very committed to {% if gender == "male" %} his {% elif gender == "female" %} her {% endif %} studies, demonstrating great understanding of the program and helping {% if gender == "male" %} his {% elif gender == "female" %} her {% endif %} course mates too. Based on academic ability, experience and commitment to further studies, I am optimistic the applicant has the ability to pursue the program {% if gender == "male" %} he {% elif gender == "female" %} she {% endif %} has applied for. I have high hopes and expectations for {% if gender == "male" %} him {% elif gender == "female" %} her {% endif %} as {% if gender == "male" %} he {% elif gender == "female" %} she {% endif %} is academically good and has great potential. It is rare to come across academically ambitious {% if gender == "male" %} students {% elif gender == "female" %} female students {% endif %} like {% if gender == "male" %} him {% elif gender == "female" %} her {% endif %} in Ghana so when I meet people of {% if gender == "male" %} his {% elif gender == "female" %} her {% endif %} kind, I take it upon myself to ensure their potential is fully realized.

            <p>
                I strongly recommend {{fullName}} for admission into the {{progApplying}} and any educational assistance {% if gender == "male" %} he {% elif gender == "female" %} she {% endif %} may apply for without any reservations. 
            </p>
            <p>Thank You</p>
